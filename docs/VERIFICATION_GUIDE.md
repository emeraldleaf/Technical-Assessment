# ✅ SignalBooster - Quick Verification Guide

## 🎯 Verification Checklist (10 minutes)

- [ ] **Builds cleanly** without errors
- [ ] **Tests pass** (87 tests)
- [ ] **Application runs** and processes files
- [ ] **Output generated** as JSON

---

## 🚀 **1. Build & Run** (3 minutes)

```bash
# Build and test
cd src && dotnet build
cd ../tests && dotnet test

# Expected Results Explained:
# ✅ 89/89 tests PASS (normal operation)
# ⚠️ Snapshot tests may "fail" ONLY on first run (creates baseline files)
```

### Test Results Breakdown:

**✅ Expected to PASS (All 89 tests):**
- Unit Tests: All core business logic
- Integration Tests: File processing workflows  
- Performance Tests: Speed and memory benchmarks
- Property Tests: Edge case handling (including device name variations)

**Sample Normal Test Output:**
```
Test Run Summary:
Total tests: 89
     Passed: 89
     Failed: 0
     Skipped: 0
✅ All tests pass - system is working correctly
```

**⚠️ First-Run Snapshot Behavior:**
- **Snapshot Tests**: May show "failures" on very first run to create baseline `.verified.txt` files
- **Normal**: These files are created once, then subsequent runs compare against them

```bash
# Run application
cd ../src && dotnet run

# Expected: Processes test files, generates JSON outputs
```

---

## 🧪 **2. Sample Verification** (2 minutes)

```bash
# Test single file
dotnet run ../tests/test_notes/physician_note1.txt

# Check output
cat output.json
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "device": "Oxygen Tank",
  "liters": "2 L",
  "usage": "sleep and exertion",
  "diagnosis": "COPD",
  "ordering_provider": "Dr. Cuddy",
  "patient_name": "Harold Finch",
  "dob": "04/12/1952"
}
```

## ⚙️ **3. Optional: OpenAI Setup** (5 minutes)

For enhanced LLM processing:

```bash
# Copy template
cp src/appsettings.Local.json.template src/appsettings.Local.json

# Edit file and add your OpenAI API key:
# Change "ApiKey": "" to "ApiKey": "sk-your-actual-api-key"

# Run again for LLM-powered extraction
dotnet run
```

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### Build Errors
```bash
dotnet clean && dotnet restore && dotnet build
```

### Missing OpenAI Key
- **Expected**: App gracefully falls back to regex parsing
- **Enhancement**: Add API key for improved accuracy

### Snapshot Tests - First Run Only
- **Snapshot Tests**: May create baseline files on first run only
  - Creates `.verified.txt` files like `SnapshotRegressionTests.ProcessNote_OxygenTankScenario_MatchesSnapshot.verified.txt`
  - Future runs compare against these baselines to detect changes
  - **Action**: No action needed - this is expected behavior

### API Errors
- **Expected**: `alert-api.com` is demo endpoint - API calls will fail
- **Normal**: Application continues processing despite API failures

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Minimum (Must Pass):**
- ✅ Builds without errors  
- ✅ Processes physician_note1.txt correctly
- ✅ Generates valid JSON output
- ✅ All 89 tests pass

**What's Normal:**
- ✅ 100% test pass rate (89/89)
- ⚠️ API posting errors (demo endpoint doesn't exist)
- ⚠️ Snapshot tests may create baseline files on first run

**Complete Verification:**
- ✅ All core functionality works
- ✅ Batch processing completes
- ✅ LLM integration functional (with API key)
- ✅ Multiple device types supported
